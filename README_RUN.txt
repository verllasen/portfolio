# ITeam - How to Run

1. Install **Node.js** (if you haven't already): https://nodejs.org/
2. Double-click **run_game.bat**.

The game will automatically install necessary files and open in your browser.

## Troubleshooting
- If the browser doesn't open, go to http://localhost:5173 manually.
- If you see connection errors, ensure the "ITeam Server" window is running.
